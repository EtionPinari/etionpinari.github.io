				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<p>
					During the course of the years as a Computer Engineer I have had to take part in many projects, in a group or on my own.<br>
					The most important ones of these projects can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/EtionPinari?tab=repositories"> GitHub repositories</a>.<br>
				</p>
				<h3 style="font-size:1.35rem;">
					Description of the projects (Programming languages ; Date)
				</h3>
				<p>
					<ul class = "proj-description">
						<li id="app-dev">
							Mobile application development (Flutter ; July 2022)
						</li>
						<p>
							We created an e-commerce mobile application with a minimalistic design look in which the main buying point is the picture of the product. The application had to send orders and payments to a backend server. The code can be found in the following  <a href="https://github.com/itsPeetah/dima-2022-eshopping" target="_blank">link</a>. <br>
						</p>
						<li id="web-dev">
							Website development (VueJS, NuxtJS, HTML, CSS ; July 2021)
						</li>
						<p>
							We had to document the implementation of a website and develop a fictitious ICT company called Hatgemini. I was in charge of the back-end, employees and articles web-pages. All the people inside the website are fetched through an API and stored in the database. Furthermore I had to implement the chatbot which provides an initial guidance to the structure of the website. Check the documentation for more information in this <a href="https://github.com/EtionPinari/hypermedia-exam/blob/productionBranch/README.md#required-documentation-for-the-evaluators-is-found-below" target="_blank">link</a>. The server is down and not in use anymore. <br>	
						</p>
						<li id="iot-impl">
							IoT device implementation (nesC, TinyOs, NodeRed, IFTTT ; June 2021)
						</li>
						<p>
							We designed and implemented a software prototype for a social distancing application. The software sends a notification to the owners' phones, after continous proximity to one-another. This project uses 'TinyOS' to create the IOT nodes and their payloads, requires Cooja to simulate (or any similar program) and finally uses Node-Red and IFTTT to communicate with mobile-phones. The GitHub repository can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/EtionPinari/IOT-project/tree/main/Final%20project" target="_blank">link</a>.
						</p>
						<li id="back-end-dev">
							Webserver development (Eclipse, JavaEE,  HTML, CSS ; February 2021)
						</li>
						<p>
							We had to create a working Webserver to handle submissions of reviews of videogames that the user had played and creating a leaderboard with the top 10 games of all time.
							The code can be found in the following <a href="https://github.com/marcopetri98/MarketingApp_Java_DB2" target="_blank">link</a>. The local server is down and not in use anymore. <br>	
						</p>
						<li>
							Online board game "Santorini" (Java ; July 2020)
						</li>
						<p>
							As one of the last projects of bachelors degree we had to recreate a pre-existing game called 
							<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIJs0k-1ync" target="_blank">Santorini</a> in which people take turns to move their workers and 
							build different levels of buildings. All this with the purpose of climbing up to the third floor of a building as to win at the game.<br>
							The game is playable both in CLI-mode (Command Line Input) and GUI (Graphical User Interface).
							This was one of the most enjoyable projects that I have been part of.<br>
							Below is shown some screenshots of the game. In-order from left to right (GUI) :<br> 1- The game connection,      2- Input request to choose worker,     3- Input request to move the worker.

						<li>
							Electronic fast codifier with Working-Zone Protocol (VHDL ; July 2020)
						</li>
						<p id="small-device-proj">
							Based on the 
							<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3336995_Working-zone_encoding_for_reducing_the_energy_in_microprocessor_address_buses">Working-Zone Encoding Protocol</a>, which saves on energy-consumption on microcomponents, we had to code the electronic part which would take care of the encoding. This is all described with great detail in <a href="https://github.com/EtionPinari/10619348_RL_proj/blob/master/Descrizione%20progetto%20-%20ita%20version.pdf" target="_blank">my VHDL repository</a> although it is only in Italian. <br>
							For a brief description of how it worked, I implemented an FSM <tag class = "small">(finite state machine)</tag> which would request from the RAM-memory the data in all the adresses, and would then find if the data belonged to one of the Working-Zones or not, flagging it to the RAM and storing it as well. 
						</p>
						<li>
							Fast Database-search algorithm (C ; August 2019)
						</li>
						<p id="fast-db-alg">
							The request was to store-delete and search accounts, and relationships between these accounts, with certain criterias (such as accounts with highest number of friends) in a timely manner. This individual project showed students why time-complexity and space in memory are highly important topics to tackle every time you build an algorithm. 
							<br> The abstract data types I implemented to save all the information and get it back in as little time as possible were: "separate chaining hash-tables" to store the names of accounts as well as <tag class = "rb"> red</tag> and <tag class = "br"> black </tag>trees for the information of the numbers of relationships.
