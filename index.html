				<p>
					My name is Etion Pinari, a MSc graduate in <a href="https://www.polimi.it/"
						target="_blank">Politecnico di Milano</a>, in the field of Computer Engineering, currently
					working as a software engineer. <br><br>
					Proficient in Italian (B2 certified CELI), English (C1 certified TOEFL) and Albanian (mother
					language) I consider myself a person who you can speak freely to. <br><br>
					I have had the pleasure of becoming experienced in many programming languages such as those of
					application
					development, data sciences, and embedded systems.<br>
					My interests in the work field consist of application development and software engineering. In my
					free time
					I tend to read books, work out, practice playing the piano, and play volleyball whenever the weather
					allows for it.<br>

									Skyline Queries in Big Data application (Python, Spark ; December 2022)

									For my thesis I had to implement a new faster algorithm to find Skyline queries in
									Big Data
									in

									less than
									half
									the time of the fastest query ever designed until then.

								<p>
									We had to document the implementation of a website and develop a fictitious ICT
									company
									called
									Hatgemini. I was in charge of the back-end, employees and articles web-pages. All
									the people
									inside the website are fetched through an API and stored in the database.
									Furthermore I had
									to
									implement the chatbot which provides an initial guidance to the structure of the
									website.

									IoT device implementation (nesC, TinyOs, NodeRed, IFTTT ; June 2021)
								</li>
								<p>
									We designed and implemented a software prototype for a social distancing
									application. The
									software sends a notification to the owners' phones, after continous proximity to
									one-another.
									This project uses 'TinyOS' to create the IOT nodes and their payloads, requires
									Cooja to
									simulate (or any similar program) and finally uses Node-Red and IFTTT to communicate
									with
									mobile-phones. The GitHub repository can be found in this <a

									Online board game "Santorini" (Java ; July 2020)
								</li>
								<p>
									As one of the last projects of bachelors degree we had to recreate a pre-existing
									game
									called
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIJs0k-1ync" target="_blank">Santorini</a>
									in which
									people take turns to move their workers and
									build different levels of buildings. All this with the purpose of climbing up to the
									third
									floor
									of a building as to win at the game.<br>
									The game is playable both in CLI-mode (Command Line Input) and GUI (Graphical User
									Interface).
									This was one of the most enjoyable projects that I have been part of.<br>
									Below is shown some screenshots of the game. In-order from left to right (GUI) :<br>
									1- The
									game
									connection, 2- Input request to choose worker, 3- Input request to move the worker.

									Electronic fast codifier with Working-Zone Protocol (VHDL ; July 2020)
								</li>
								<p id="small-device-proj">
									Based on the
									<a
										href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3336995_Working-zone_encoding_for_reducing_the_energy_in_microprocessor_address_buses">Working-Zone
										Encoding Protocol</a>, which saves on energy-consumption on microcomponents, we
									had to
									code
									the electronic part which would take care of the encoding. This is all described
									with great
									detail in <a
										href="https://github.com/EtionPinari/10619348_RL_proj/blob/master/Descrizione%20progetto%20-%20ita%20version.pdf"
										target="_blank">my VHDL repository</a> although it is only in Italian. <br>
									For a brief description of how it worked, I implemented a finite state machine which
									would
									request from the
									RAM-memory the data in all the adresses, and
									would then find if the data belonged to one of the Working-Zones or not, flagging it
									to the
									RAM
									and storing it as well.
								</p>
								<li>
									Fast Database-search algorithm (C ; August 2019)
								</li>
								<p>
									The request was to store-delete and search accounts, and relationships between these
									accounts,
									with certain criterias (such as accounts with highest number of friends) in a timely
									manner.
									This individual project showed students why time-complexity and space in memory are
									highly
									important topics to tackle every time you build an algorithm.
									<br> The abstract data types I implemented to save all the information and get it
									back in as
									little time as possible were: "separate chaining hash-tables" to store the names of
									accounts
									as
									well as <tag class="rb"> red</tag> and <tag class="br"> black </tag>trees for the
									information of
									the numbers of relationships.
